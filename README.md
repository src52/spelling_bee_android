# Spelling Bee Game, Android

- Built using Jetpack Compose, following Material Design 3 patterns
- Wrote AWS Lambda functions to validate words against a dictionary

This project started in June 2025. My friends sucked me into the whole *New York Times* Wordle craze. On that app, they have a few other games including Spelling Bee.

It's an interesting puzzle game: given seven letters laid out in a honeycomb shape, try to spell as many words as you can that all contain the center letter.

I wouldn't have started this project, except that the *New York Times* decided that users could only play three or four words before being locked out, and prompted to purchase their six-dollar a month subscription! The programmer within me quickly dissected that this game wouldn't be too difficult to implement, so I would feel silly paying $6 a month forever to play something that I could probably build myself.

I wanted to learn more about serverless technologies like AWS Lambda at the time, so I figured this would be a good opportunity to try it out.
